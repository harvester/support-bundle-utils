# Support Bundle Kit [![Build Status](http://drone-publish.rancher.io/api/badges/rancher/support-bundle-kit/status.svg)](http://drone-publish.rancher.io/rancher/support-bundle-kit)

**working in progress**

This project contains support bundle scripts and utilities for applications running on top of Kubernetes

- `harvester-sb-collector.sh`: The script is used to collect k3os node logs. It can be run in a container with the host log folder mapped or be run on the host directly.
- `support-bundle-utils`: This application contains several commands:
  - `manager`: start a support bundle kit manager. The manager does these works:
    - It collects the cluster bundle, including YAML manifests and pod logs.
    - It collects external bundles. e.g., Longhorn support bundle.
    - It starts a web server and waits for bundle downloading and uploading.
    - It starts a daemonset on each node. The agents in the daemonset collect node bundles and push them back to the manager.

    The manager is designed to be spawned as a Kubernetes deployment by the application. But it can also be deployed manually from a manifest file. Please check [standalone mode](./docs/standalone.md) for more information.
  - `simulate`: the command allows users to simulate a end user environment by loading the support bundle into a minimal apiserver allowing end users to browse the objects and logs from the support bundle. It will do the following things
    - It runs an embedded etcd server
    - It runs a minimal apiserver only
    - It runs a minimal kubelet
  

## Support bundle contents

The Harvester support bundle is structured as the following layout:

```yaml
- [logs]            # pod logs, organized by namespaces
  - [namespace1]
    - [pod1]
     - container1.log
    - [pod2]
  - [namespace2]
    - [pod1]

- [yamls]           # definition of resources
  - [cluster]        # cluster scope
    - [kubernetes]    # Kubernetes resources
      - nodes.yaml
      - volumeattachments.yaml

      - settings.yaml
      - users.yaml
